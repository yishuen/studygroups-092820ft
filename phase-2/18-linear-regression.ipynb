    "* **Degrees of Freedom Residuals**: Degrees of freedom of the residuals, which is the number of observations – number of parameters. Intercept is a parameter. The purpose of Degrees of Freedom is to reflect the impact of descriptive/summarizing statistics in the model, which in regression is the coefficient. Since the observations must \"live up\" to these parameters, they only have so many free observations, and the rest must be reserved to \"live up\" to the parameters' prophecy. This internal mechanism ensures that there are enough observations to match the parameters.\n",

    "* **Prob (F-statistic) or P-Value**: The probability that a sample like this would yield the above statistic, and whether the model's verdict on the null hypothesis will consistently represent the population. Does not measure effect magnitude, instead measures the integrity and consistency of this test on this group of data.\n",

    "* **Kurtosis**: A measure of the shape of the distribution. Compares the amount of data close to the mean with those far away from the mean (in the tails), so model \"peakiness\". The normal distribution has a Kurtosis of 3, and the greater the number, the more the curve peaks.\n",

    "Regression is a parametric technique, which means that it uses parameters learned from the data. Because of that, certain assumptions must be made. These assumptions define the complete scope of regression analysis and it is **mandatory** that the underlying data fulfills these assumptions. If violated, regression makes biased and unreliable predictions. Luckily, we have measures to check for these assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Linearity\n",
    "\n",
    "> The linearity assumptions requires that there is a **linear relationship** between the response variable (Y) and predictor (X). Linear means that the change in Y by 1-unit change in X, is constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/lin_2.png\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown above, If we try to fit a linear model to a non-linear data set, OLS will fail to capture the trend mathematically, resulting in an inaccurate relationship. This will also result in erroneous predictions on an unseen data set.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">The linearity assumption can best be tested with scatter plots \n",
    "\n",
    "For non-linear relationships, you can use non-linear mathematical functions to fit the data e.g. polynomial and exponential functions. You'll come across these later. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: As an extra measure, it is also important to check for outliers as the presence of outliers in the data can have a major impact on the model.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/outliers.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "> The normality assumption states that the **model residuals** should follow a normal distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the normality assumption talks about the **model residuals** and _not_ about the distributions of the **variables**! In general, data scientists will often check the distributions of the variables as well. Keep in mind that the normality assumption is mandatory for the residuals, and it is useful to check normality of your variables to check for weirdness (more on data distributions later), but OLS works fine for non-normal data distributions in the context of prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to check for the normality assumption is with histograms or a Q-Q-Plots. \n",

    "### Histograms\n",
    "We have already seen quite a few histograms and also know how to build them. You can use histograms to check the errors generated by the model and see if the plot shows a so-called \"normal distribution\" (bell curve shape). As the error term follows a normal distribution, we can develop better confidence in the results and calculate the statistical significance. An example of a regression error histogram is shown below:\n",

For regression, when checking if the data in this sample is normally distributed, we can use a Normal Q-Q plot to test that assumption. Remember that this is just a visual check, so the interpretation remains subjective. However, it is a good first check to see the overall shape of your data against the required distribution. If you can reject normality through Q-Q plots, you have saved yourself from a lot of statistical testing. You have to be careful, however, when deciding that data is totally normal just by looking at a Q-Q plot.\n",

    "\n",
    "Below, you can find a few examples of comparing histograms and corresponding plots. You can see how the quantiles of normal data appear as a straight line along the diagonal when plotted against a standard normal distribution's quantiles. The skewness and kurtosis of data can also be inspected this way  \n",

    "<img src=\"images/inhouse_qq_plots.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
